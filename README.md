# Wasteland
Welcome to my first Rails project. The goal of this project was to start learning Rails.
___

Join the desolate expanse that is Wasteland, a non-social network. Send your posts out into the void of the internet never to be seen or enjoyed. Try and fail to form emotional connections to a non-existent user base. And don't forget to have a way one conversation through comments on posts that won't ever be posted.

Things you can do on Wasteland:
- Add friends
- Submit posts with text or images
- Comment on posts
- View a feed of your friend's posts and comments
- Customize a profile including uploading an avatar
